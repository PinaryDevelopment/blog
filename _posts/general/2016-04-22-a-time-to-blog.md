title: A Time to Blog
excerpt: A decision to begin committing my thoughts on software development to a blog.
---

I've been doing a number of things at work as of late that I've found very interesting. 

For my own records as well as for the benefit of others, I thought I would start a blog to record some of these adventures. 

There have been a number of issues Iâ€™ve encountered and a lot of "[Bingle-ing](javascript(0) "Combination of Bing and Google")" has been done to accomplish the final product. 

My hope is that through the posts and related/linked GitHub repositories, I can save others some time on their quest to accomplish similar goals.

While I don't expect too many people to stumble upon my site, if you do and have a comment or suggestion, please feel free to leave it. I really enjoy coding and I especially enjoy learning from others.
