title: "Writer's Block"
---

I've been working on quite a number of things lately that I've found very exciting and have found it quite frustrating that I haven't ~~found~~ made the time to write about them.

While this post is really sparse, I'm utilizing it to put out the things I hope to blog about in the near future as a kick in the pants to actually write about them, or break the writer's block.

I've started a few new projects.

- One application is supposed to be accessed by multiple clients each of which would like to have a custom look-and-feel for their users in line with their corporate brand.
 - The application is utilizing:
     - AngularJS4
     - ASP.NET Core
     - Semantic-UI
     - Entity Framework Core
     - Azure Search
     - VSTS
 - I've created an npm script that allows me to build multiple Semantic UI themes at once.
 - I've created a few additional custom build scripts(some of which I've found I don't actually need) and have learned a lot in the process.

- Another application is a pro-bono project I'm working on for a cause I believe in.
 - The application is utilizing:
     - Aurelia
     - ASP.NET Core
     - SCSS
     - Entity Framework Core
     - Azure Blob Storage

Both of these have pushed my limits in different ways and I hope to be able to share those experiences and bruises to help pave the way forward for others.
