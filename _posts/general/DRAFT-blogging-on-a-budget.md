About a year ago, I set about to redesign my blog. I had used [ghost](https://blog.ghost.org/) for the first implementation of my blog. It was a pretty nice platform, but running it on the cheap was always an issue(their hosted platform isn't cheap). Obviously, paying for hosting on a variety of platforms is an option, but none that I found were inexpensive and given that I'm not making a penny on the site currently...

I initially set it up on an Azure website utilizing the [Ghost-Azure](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/Ghost-Azure) tool. This is a slick tool that sets everything up nicely for you, but I found that I didn't understand it very well and it became clear pretty quickly that upgrading with it wasn't going to be easy. The version of ghost I was running, quickly became out-dated and I knew eventually I would want to find something else.

In addition, while Azure provides some free websites when you sign up, the sites are limited in that it is only free if you don't use a custom domain. That ruled it out for me. There were a few other annoyances such as setting up SSL with a custom domain and getting posts routed to properly while trying to setup a custom domain through Google Domains and having it route properly to the Azure app.

All of these factors, made it clear to me that I would have to look down a different path.
