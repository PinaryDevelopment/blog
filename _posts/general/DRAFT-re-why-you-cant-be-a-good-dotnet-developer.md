I read a quote recently that I really enjoyed, especially given this corporate context. Jerry Weinberg, in The Psychology of Computer Programming, said, **"If a programmer is indispensable, get rid of him as quickly as possible!"** While I haven't read Mr. Weinberg's book, in my experience, the above trap comes with a host of issues for the software as well as the development teams. Often the 'indispensability' comes along with a laziness. It encourages quick fixes and masking of problems, which in turn, reaffirms the 'job security' of that individual. There generally can be found a LOT of copy-pasta code as well.
