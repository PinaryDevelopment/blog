title: "Being A Good Consumer Or Documentation: We Don't Need No Stinking Documentation"
excerpt: ''
---

As there are two sides to every coin, I believe it is worth discussing the other side of the aisle as well. We need to be good consumers of documentation. I can't tell you how many StackOverflow questions solely revolve around the developer in question not taking ANY time to even attempt to research and read the wonderful documentation that exists for a given library/language. We, as consumers, need to take some time to look for documentation and read it before we start asking for help from others. If you find that there is an aspect of a library that you know well and have answered numerous questions regarding it, submit a pull request to the documentation with your knowledge. Even submit pull requests for typos. Take some time to give back and help make the documentation better for everyone else. We as an industry rely heavily on StackOverflow for help. If you have a question, have spent some time researching it without finding an answer, take some time writing your question. Give some background, provide links to documentation or examples you've used. In essence, make the question documentation for others.
